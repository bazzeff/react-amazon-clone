Consequently, Christmas tree production and other production involving production cycles of less than 10 years, are classified in the Crop Production subsector.\nIndustries in this subsector specialize in different stages of the production cycle. Reforestation requires production of seedlings in specialized nurseries. Timber production requires natural forest or suitable areas of land that are available for a long duration. The maturation time for timber depends upon the species of tree, the climatic conditions of the region, and the intended purpose of the timber. The harvesting of timber (except when done on an extremely small scale) requires specialized machinery unique to the industry.

The term \"mining\" is used in the broad sense to include ore extraction, quarrying, and beneficiating (e.g., crushing, screening, washing, sizing, concentrating, and flotation), customarily done at the mine site.\nBeneficiation is the process whereby the extracted material is reduced to particles which can be separated into mineral and waste, the former suitable for further processing or direct use. The operations that take place in beneficiation are primarily mechanical, such as grinding, washing, magnetic separation, centrifugal separation, and so on. In contrast, manufacturing operations primarily use chemical and electrochemical processes, such as electrolysis, distillation, and so on. However some treatments, such as heat treatments, take place in both stages: the beneficiation and the manufacturing (i.e., smelting/refining) stages. The range of preparation activities varies by mineral and the purity of any given ore deposit. While some minerals, such as petroleum and natural gas, require little or no preparation, others are washed and screened, while yet others, such as gold and silver, can be transformed into bullion before leaving the mine site.\nEstablishments in the Mining (except Oil and Gas) subsector include those that have complete responsibility for operating mines and quarries (except oil and gas wells) and those that operate mines and quarries (except oil and gas wells) for others on a contract or fee basis. Establishments primarily engaged in providing support services, on acontract or fee basis, required for the mining and quarrying of minerals are classified in Subsector 213, Support Activities for Mining.\n                ",

The operations that take place in beneficiation are primarily mechanical, such as grinding, washing, magnetic separation, and centrifugal separation. In contrast, manufacturing operations primarily use chemical and electrochemical processes, such as electrolysis and distillation. However, some treatments, such as heat treatments, take place in both the beneficiation and the manufacturing (i.e., smelting/refining) stages. The range of preparation activities varies by mineral and the purity of any given ore deposit. While some minerals, such as petroleum and natural gas, require little or no preparation, others are washed and screened, while yet others, such as gold and silver, can be transformed into bullion before leaving the mine site.",

The work performed may include new work, additions, alterations, maintenance, and repairs. The production work performed by establishments in this subsector is usually subcontracted from establishments of the general contractor type or for-sale builders, but especially in remodeling and repair construction, work also may be done directly for the owner of the property. Specialty trade contractors usually perform most of their work at the construction site, although they may have shops where they perform prefabrication and other work. Establishments primarily engaged in preparing sites for new construction are also included in this subsector. There are substantial differences in types of equipment, work force skills, and other inputs required by specialty trade contractors. Establishments in this subsector are classified based on the underlying production function for the specialty trade in which they specialize. Throughout the Specialty Trade Contractors subsector, establishments commonly provide both the parts and labor required to complete work. For example, electrical contractors supply the current-carrying and noncurrent-carrying wiring devices that are required to install a circuit. Plumbing, heating, and air-conditioning contractors also supply the parts required to complete a contract. Establishments that specialize in activities primarily related to heavy and civil engineering construction that are not normally performed on buildings, such as the painting of lines on highways, are classified in Subsector 237, Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction. Establishments that are primarily engaged in selling construction materials are classified in Sector 42, Wholesale Trade, or Sector 44-45, Retail Trade, based on the characteristics of the selling unit.",

The manufacturing of these products is grouped together because they constitute a series of vertically connected processes. More than one is often carried out in a single establishment. There are essentially three activities. The manufacturing of pulp involves separating the cellulose fibers from other impurities in wood or used paper. The manufacturing of paper involves matting these fibers into a sheet. The manufacturing of converted paper products involves converting paper and other materials by various cutting and shaping techniques and includes coating and laminating activities.\nThe Paper Manufacturing subsector is subdivided into two industry groups, the first for the manufacturing of pulp and paper and the second for the manufacturing of converted paper products. Paper making is treated as the core activity of the subsector. Therefore, any establishment that makes paper (including paperboard), either alone or in combination with pulp manufacturing or paper converting, is classified as a paper or paperboard mill. Establishments that make pulp without making paper are classified as pulp mills. Pulp mills, paper mills and paperboard mills comprise the first industry group.\nEstablishments that make products from purchased paper and other materials make up the second industry group, Converted Paper Product Manufacturing. This general activity is then subdivided based, for the most part, on process distinctions. Paperboard container manufacturing uses corrugating, cutting, and shaping machinery to form paperboard into containers. Paper bag and coated and treated paper manufacturing establishments cut and coat paper and foil. Stationery product manufacturing establishments make a variety of paper products used for writing, filing, and similar applications. Other converted paper product manufacturing includes, in particular, the conversion of sanitary paper stock into such things as tissue paper and disposable diapers.\nAn important process used in the Paper Bag and Coated and Treated Paper Manufacturing industry is lamination, often combined with coating. Lamination and coating make a composite material with improved properties of strength, impermeability, and so on. The laminated materials may be paper, metal foil, or plastics film. While paper is often one of the components, it is not always. Lamination of plastics film to plastics film is classified in Subsector 326, Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing, because establishments that do this often first make the film. The same situation holds with respect to bags. The manufacturing of bags from plastics only, whether or not laminated, is classified in Subsector 326, Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing, but all other bag manufacturing is classified in this subsector.\nExcluded from this subsector are photosensitive papers. These papers are chemically treated and are classified in Industry 32599, All Other Chemical Product and Preparation Manufacturing.",

The printing processes employed include, but are not limited to, lithographic, gravure, screen, flexographic, digital, and letterpress.\nIn contrast to many other classification systems that locate publishing of printed materials in manufacturing, NAICS classifies the publishing of printed products in Subsector 511, Publishing Industries (except Internet). Though printing and publishing are often carried out by the same enterprise (a newspaper, for example), it is less and less the case that these distinct activities are carried out in the same establishment. When publishing and printing are done in the same establishment, the establishment is classified in Sector 51, Information, in the appropriate NAICS industry even if the receipts for printing exceed those for publishing.\nThis subsector includes printing on clothing because the production process for that activity is printing, not clothing manufacturing.

Establishments specialize in making\nmachinery designed for particular applications. Thus, design is considered to be part of the production process for\nthe purpose of implementing NAICS. The NAICS structure reflects this by defining industries and industry groups\nthat make machinery for different applications. A broad distinction exists between machinery that is generally used\nin a variety of industrial applications (i.e., general purpose machinery) and machinery that is designed to be used in\na particular industry (i.e., special purpose machinery). Three industry groups consist of special purpose machinery--\nAgricultural, Construction, and Mining Machinery Manufacturing; Industrial Machinery Manufacturing; and\nCommercial and Service Industry Machinery Manufacturing. The other industry groups make general purpose\nmachinery: Ventilation, Heating, Air-Conditioning, and Commercial Refrigeration Equipment Manufacturing;\nMetalworking Machinery Manufacturing; Engine, Turbine, and Power Transmission Equipment Manufacturing; and\nOther General Purpose Machinery Manufacturing.",

The Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing industries\nhave been combined in the hierarchy of NAICS because of the economic significance they have attained. Their\nrapid growth suggests that they will become even more important to the economies of all three North American\ncountries in the future, and in addition their manufacturing processes are fundamentally different from the\nmanufacturing processes of other machinery and equipment. The design and use of integrated circuits and the\napplication of highly specialized miniaturization technologies are common elements in the production technologies\nof the Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing subsector. Convergence of technology motivates this\nNAICS subsector. Digitalization of sound recording, for example, causes both the medium (the compact disc) and\nthe equipment to resemble the technologies for recording, storing, transmitting, and manipulating data.\nCommunications technology and equipment have been converging with computer technology. When\ntechnologically-related components are in the same sector, it makes it easier to adjust the classification for future\nchanges, without needing to redefine its basic structure. The creation of the Computer and Electronic Product\nManufacturing subsector assists in delineating new and emerging industries because the activities that will serve as\nthe probable sources of new industries, such as computer manufacturing and communications equipment\nmanufacturing, or computers and audio equipment, are brought together. As new activities emerge, they are less\nlikely to cross the subsector boundaries of the classification.",

		"industry_description" : "Industries in the Furniture and Related Product Manufacturing subsector make furniture and related articles, such\nas mattresses, window blinds, cabinets, and fixtures. The processes used in the manufacture of furniture include the\ncutting, bending, molding, laminating, and assembly of such materials as wood, metal, glass, plastics, and rattan.\nHowever, the production process for furniture is not solely bending metal, cutting and shaping wood, or extruding\nand molding plastics. Design and fashion trends play an important part in the production of furniture. The\nintegrated design of the article for both esthetic and functional qualities is also a major part of the process of\nmanufacturing furniture. Design services may be performed by the furniture establishments work force or may be\npurchased from industrial designers.\nFurniture may be made of any material, but the most common ones used in North America are metal and wood.\nFurniture manufacturing establishments may specialize in making articles primarily from one material. Some of the\nequipment required to make a wooden table, for example, is different from that used to make a metal one. However,\nfurniture is usually made from several materials. A wooden table might have metal brackets, and a wooden chair a\nfabric or plastics seat. Therefore, in NAICS, furniture initially is classified based on the type of furniture\n(application for which it is designed) rather than the material used. For example, an upholstered sofa is treated as\nhousehold furniture, although it may also be used in hotels or offices.\nWhen classifying furniture according to the component material from which it is made, furniture made from more\nthan one material is classified based on the material used in the frame, or if there is no frame, the predominant\ncomponent material. Upholstered household furniture (excluding kitchen and dining room chairs with upholstered\nseats) is classified without regard to the frame material. Kitchen or dining room chairs with upholstered seats are\nclassified according to the frame material.\nFurniture may be made on a stock or custom basis and may be shipped assembled or unassembled (i.e.,\nknockdown). The manufacture of furniture parts and frames is included in this subsector.\nSome of the processes used in furniture manufacturing are similar to processes that are used in other segments of\nmanufacturing. For example, cutting and assembly occurs in the production of wood trusses that are classified in\nSubsector 321, Wood Product Manufacturing. However, the multiple processes that distinguish wood furniture\nmanufacturing from wood product manufacturing warrant inclusion of wooden furniture manufacturing in the\nFurniture and Related Product Manufacturing subsector. Metal furniture manufacturing uses techniques that are also\nemployed in the manufacturing of roll formed products classified in Subsector 332, Fabricated Metal Product\nManufacturing. The molding process for plastics furniture is similar to the molding of other plastics products.\nHowever, plastics furniture producing establishments tend to specialize in furniture.\nNAICS attempts to keep furniture manufacturing together, but there are two notable exceptions: seating for\ntransportation equipment and specialized hospital furniture (e.g., hospital beds and operating tables). These\nexceptions are related to the fact that some of the aspects of the production process for these products, primarily the\ndesign, are highly integrated with the other manufactured goods, namely motor vehicles and medical equipment.",

The\nprocesses for these products differ from each other, and the processes differ significantly from the fabrication\nprocesses used in making dolls or toys, the melting and shaping of precious metals to make jewelry, and the\nbending, forming, and assembly used in making medical products.\nThe industries in this subsector are defined by what is made rather than how it is made.

The subsector is subdivided into general freight trucking and specialized\nfreight trucking. This distinction reflects differences in equipment used, type of load carried, scheduling, terminal,\nand other networking services. General freight transportation establishments handle a wide variety of general\ncommodities, generally palletized, and transported in a container or van trailer. Specialized freight transportation is\nthe transportation of cargo that, because of size, weight, shape, or other inherent characteristics, requires specialized\nequipment for transportation.\n Each of these industry groups is further subdivided based on distance traveled. Local trucking establishments\nprimarily carry goods within a single metropolitan area and its adjacent nonurban areas. Long-distance trucking\nestablishments carry goods between metropolitan areas.\n The Specialized Freight Trucking industry group includes a separate industry for Used Household and Office\nGoods Moving. The household and office goods movers are separated because of the substantial network of\nestablishments that has developed to deal with local and long-distance moving and the associated storage. In this\narea, the same establishment provides both local and long-distance services, while other specialized freight\nestablishments generally limit their services to either local or long-distance hauling.",

Works may be in one or more formats including traditional print form, CD-ROM, or\nproprietary electronic networks. Publishers may publish works originally created by others for which they have\nobtained the rights and/or works that they have created in-house. Software publishing is included here because the\nactivity, creation of a copyrighted product and bringing it to market, is equivalent to the creation process for other\ntypes of intellectual products.\n In NAICS, publishing--the reporting, writing, editing, and other processes that are required to create an edition of\na newspaper--is treated as a major economic activity in its own right, rather than as a subsidiary activity to a\nmanufacturing activity, printing. Thus, publishing is classified in the Information sector; whereas, printing remains\nin the Manufacturing sector. In part, the NAICS classification reflects the fact that publishing increasingly takes\nplace in establishments that are physically separate from the associated printing establishments. More crucially, the\nNAICS classification of book and newspaper publishing is intended to portray their roles in a modern economy, in\nwhich they do not resemble manufacturing activities.\n Music publishers are not included in the Publishing Industries (except Internet) subsector, but are included in the\nMotion Picture and Sound Recording Industries subsector. Reproduction of prepackaged software is treated in\nNAICS as a manufacturing activity; on-line distribution of software products is in the Information sector; and\ncustom design of software to client specifications is included in the Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services\nsector. These distinctions arise because of the different ways that software is created, reproduced, and distributed.\n The Publishing Industries (except Internet) subsector includes establishments that publish software exclusively on\nthe Internet but excludes establishments that publish other content exclusively on the Internet. Establishments\npublishing content other than software exclusively on the Internet are included in Subsector 519, Other Information\nServices. The Publishing Industries (except Internet) subsector also excludes products, such as manifold business\nforms and appointment books. Information is not the essential component of these items. Establishments producing\nthese items are included in Subsector 323, Printing and Related Support Activities.",

		"industry_description" : "Industries in the Rental and Leasing Services subsector include establishments that provide a wide array of\ntangible goods, such as automobiles, computers, consumer goods, and industrial machinery and equipment, to\ncustomers in return for a periodic rental or lease payment.\n The subsector includes two main types of establishments: (1) those that are engaged in renting consumer goods\nand equipment and (2) those that are engaged in leasing machinery and equipment often used for business\noperations. The first type typically operates from a retail-like or storefront facility and maintains inventories of\ngoods that are rented for short periods of time. The latter type typically does not operate from retail-like locations or\nmaintain inventories, and offers longer-term leases. These establishments work directly with clients to enable them\nto acquire the use of equipment on a lease basis, or they work with equipment vendors or dealers to support the\nmarketing of equipment to their customers under lease arrangements. Equipment lessors generally structure lease\ncontracts to meet the specialized needs of their clients and use their remarketing expertise to find other users for\npreviously leased equipment. Establishments that provide operating and capital (i.e., finance) leases are included in\nthis subsector.\n Establishments primarily engaged in leasing in combination with providing loans are classified in Sector 52,\nFinance and Insurance. Establishments primarily engaged in leasing real property are classified in Subsector 531,\nReal Estate. Establishments primarily engaged in renting or leasing equipment with operators are classified in\nvarious subsectors of NAICS depending on the nature of the services provided (e.g., transportation, construction,\nagriculture). These activities are excluded from this subsector since the client is paying for the expertise and\nknowledge of the equipment operator, in addition to the rental of the equipment. In many cases, such as the rental of\nheavy construction equipment, the operator is essential to operate the equipment. Likewise, since the provision of\ncrop harvesting services includes both the equipment and operator, it is included in Subsector 115, Support\nActivities for Agriculture and Forestry. The rental or leasing of copyrighted works is classified in Sector 51,\nInformation, and the rental or leasing of assets, such as patents, trademarks, and/or licensing agreements, is\nclassified in Subsector 533, Lessors of Nonfinancial Intangible Assets (except Copyrighted Works).",

Recent trends, however, are to contract\nor purchase such services from businesses that specialize in such activities and can, therefore, provide the services\nmore efficiently.\n The industries in this subsector cannot be viewed as strictly \"support.\" The Travel Arrangement and Reservation\nServices industry group includes travel agents, tour operators, and providers of other travel arrangement services,\nsuch as hotel and restaurant reservations and arranging the purchase of tickets, serving many types of clients,\nincluding individual consumers. This group was placed in this subsector because the services are often of the\n\"support\" nature (e.g., travel arrangement), and businesses and other organizations increasingly purchase such\nservices.\n The administrative and management activities performed by establishments in this sector are typically on a\ncontract or fee basis.

		"industry_description" : "Industries in the Performing Arts, Spectator Sports, and Related Industries subsector group establishments that\nproduce or organize and promote live presentations involving the performances of actors and actresses, singers,\ndancers, musical groups and artists, athletes, and other entertainers, including independent (i.e., freelance)\nentertainers and the establishments that manage their careers. The classification recognizes four basic processes: (1)\nproducing (i.e., presenting) events; (2) organizing, managing, and/or promoting events; (3) managing and\nrepresenting entertainers; and (4) providing the artistic, creative and technical skills necessary to the production of\nthese live events. Also, this subsector contains four industries for performing arts companies. Each is defined on\nthe basis of the particular skills of the entertainers involved in the presentations.\n The industry structure for this subsector makes a clear distinction between performing arts companies and\nperforming artists (i.e., independent or freelance). Although not unique to arts and entertainment, freelancing is a\nparticularly important phenomenon in this Performing Arts, Spectator Sports, and Related Industries subsector.\nDistinguishing this activity from the production activity is a meaningful process differentiation. This approach,\nhowever, is difficult to implement in the case of musical groups (i.e., companies) and artists, especially pop groups.\nThese establishments tend to be more loosely organized and it can be difficult to distinguish companies from\nfreelancers. For this reason, NAICS includes one industry that covers both musical groups and musical artists.\n This subsector contains two industries for Industry Group 7113, Promoters of Performing Arts, Sports, and Similar\nEvents, one for those that operate facilities and another for those that do not. This is because there are significant\ndifferences in cost structures between those promoters that manage and provide the staff to operate facilities and\nthose that do not. In addition to promoters without facilities, other industries in this subsector include\nestablishments that may operate without permanent facilities. These types of establishments include performing arts\ncompanies; musical groups and artists; spectator sports; and independent (i.e., freelance) artists, writers, and\nperformers.\n Excluded from this subsector are nightclubs. Some nightclubs promote live entertainment on a regular basis and it\ncan be argued that they could be classified in Industry Group 7113, Promoters of Performing Arts, Sports, and\nSimilar Events. However, since most of these establishments function as any other drinking place when they do not\npromote entertainment and because most of their revenue is derived from sale of food and beverages, they are\nclassified in Subsector 722, Food Services and Drinking Places.",

These establishments also typically provide general or routine maintenance (i.e., servicing) on such products\nto ensure they work efficiently and to prevent breakdown and unnecessary repairs.\n The NAICS structure for this subsector brings together most types of repair and maintenance establishments and\ncategorizes them based on production processes (i.e., on the type of repair and maintenance activity performed, and\nthe necessary skills, expertise, and processes that are found in different repair and maintenance establishments).\nThis NAICS classification does not delineate between repair services provided to businesses versus those that serve\nhouseholds. Although some industries primarily serve either businesses or households, separation by class of\ncustomer is limited by the fact that many establishments serve both. Establishments repairing computers and\nconsumer electronics products are two examples of such overlap.\n The Repair and Maintenance subsector does not include all establishments that do repair and maintenance. For\nexample, a substantial amount of repair is done by establishments that also manufacture machinery, equipment, and\nother goods. These establishments are included in the Manufacturing sector in NAICS. In addition, repair of\ntransportation equipment is often provided by or based at transportation facilities, such as airports and seaports, and\nthese activities are included in the Transportation and Warehousing sector. A particularly unique situation exists\nwith repair of buildings. Plumbing, electrical installation and repair, painting and decorating, and other\nconstruction-related establishments are often involved in performing installation or other work on new construction\nas well as providing repair services on existing structures. While some specialize in repair, it is difficult to\ndistinguish between the two types and all are included in the Construction sector.\n Excluded from this subsector are establishments primarily engaged in rebuilding or remanufacturing machinery\nand equipment. These are classified in Sector 31-33, Manufacturing. Also excluded are retail establishments that\nprovide after-sale services and repair. These are classified in Sector 44-45, Retail Trade.",
